# MTG-Card-Generator

A simple card generator that creates Magic: the Gathering cards in M15 frame format for use in the MTG game Forge.  Takes card art, templates, mana symbols, JSON data objects from mtgjson: https://mtgjson.com/ and locations of files as inputs, and outputs cards in their proper directories with proper card suffixes in the card art folder Forge/Cache.

This generator was designed for personal use, and many of the inputs have not been uploaded for copyright purposes.  Furthermore, proper fonts are needed for proper rendering, including Wizard of the Coast's proprietary font, Beleren.
